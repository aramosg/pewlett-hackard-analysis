# Module 7 â€“ Employee database with SQL
# Unit Challenge
## Overview of the Project 
After realizing the amount of people that wouls be retiring in the short and mid term, we have been asked to discover the amount of employees that will be retiring per title. Also, we need to discover the employees that eligible for a mentorhsip program.

The results we deliver will be utilized to train and coach the next generation of Managers and Senior Staffers. This wil avoid the company many burdens when it comes to work force management, staff turnover, and employee readines.

## Results of the analysis

### Finding the retiring employees
In order to have a contingency plan, first we need to know how big the impact will be. Let's see how many people will be retiring, per title:

Count of retirement titles:

![unique_retirement_titles_count](/resources/unique_retirement_titles_count.png)

That is a total of 72,458 positions, from Engineers and Staffers, to Managers. The technical/engineering Teams are going to be the ones with the highest impact from this wave of retirements. When it comes to management, it gets my attention that only to Managers are retiring in the short term. 

Why are we in this situation? Many questions come to my mind:
1. Are there more technical positions than the company needs?
2. Do we have a training/coaching program for technical positions? What about Management?
3. It is good to know that many people have been working for the company for a long time. What is the company doing to keep these staffers happy, and up-to-date when it comes to technical knowledge?

A great idea is to have a coaching/mentorship program, where Managers and Senior Staff can train junior employees to take management positions in the future. The expected result of this program is to have a succession plan. With this output, management and senior positions can be assigned to employees with the hard and soft skills for the position.

### Mentorship Program
The company has decided to start a mentorship program, which is a great idea. With this, they will be ready to get a replacement as fast as they can whenever a key employee leaves the company. Also, I believe this will increase employees' engagement. This can be part of their career development. 

Sample of employees ready for the Mentorship Program:

![mentorship_eligibility](/resources/mentorship_eligibilty.png)

We have 1,549 employees ready for the Program. If we compare statistics, this is a low number compared to the number of people retiring in the short term. 

For now, the only criteria to select people for the mentorship program is "hiring date". Honestly, I do not think that is a good idea. Other factors should be considered:
1. Hiring date
2. Career ambitions
3. Attitude
4. Soft skills

This mentorship program comes as a result from the crisis the company will be facing in the short term. This should stay as a permanent strategy to define succession plans and help employees builfing their career paths. 

## Summary and Conclusion

**How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?** 
As analyzed before, we have seven different roles that will have an impact with the "silver tsunami", from Staffers to Managers. This represents 72,458 positions. 

**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
This is a tough question to ask:
1. We have many Senior (Engineers and Staff) positions that will be retiring. It is not only a matter of numbers. We need to further investigate if people in Junior positions have the required skills to take over Senior positions. If this is not the case, besides succession plans, we also urgently need career development plans.
2. We only have two Managers that will be retiring soon. Comparing the numbers of Managers versus the number of Staffers, this number is too low. Why? Does it mean that Managers have a succession plan already in place? Do we have more staff than needed? We need to get more data in order to answer these questions. 

The Company failed to foresee the impact that was coming. With employees working here for a long time, I guess it was hard to anticipate it. Beyond the development of this new mentorship program, we need to find answer to the questions written above. We need to start working on a better strategy for employee development: temporary assignments, succession plans, career plans, and training workshops can be all part of a bigger strategy for employees development and retention.
