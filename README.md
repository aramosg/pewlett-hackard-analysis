# Module 7 â€“ Employee database with SQL
# Unit Challenge
## Overview of the Project 
After realizing the amount of people that wouls be retiring in the short and mid term, we have been asked to discover the amount of employees that will be retiring per title. Also, we need to discover the employees that eligible for a mentorhsip program.

The results we deliver will be utilized to train and coach the next generation of Managers and Senior Staffers. This wil avoind the company many burdens when it comes to work force management, staff turnover, and employees readines.

## Results of the analysis

### Finding the retiring employees
In order to have a contingency plan, first we need to know how big the impact will be. Let's see how many people will be retiring, per title:

Count of retirement titles:

![unique_retirement_titles_count](/resources/unique_retirement_titles_count.png)

That is a total of 72,458 positions, from Engineers and Staffers, to Managers. The technical/engineering Teams are going to be the ones with the highest impacts from this wave of retirements. When it comes to management, it gets my attention that only to Managers are retiring in the short term. 

Why are we in this situation? Many questions come to my mind:
1. Are there more technical positions than the company needs?
2. Do we have a training/coaching program for technical positions? What about Management?
3. It is good to know that many people have been working for the company for a long time. What is the company doing to keep these staffers happy, and up-to-date when it comes to technical knowledge?

A great idea is to have a coaching/mentorship program, where Managers and Senior Staff can train junior employees to take management positions in the future. The expected result of this program is to have a succession plan. With this output, management and senior positions can be assigned to employees with the hard and soft skills for the position.

### Mentorship Program
The company has decided to start a mentorship program, which is a great idea. With this, they will be ready to get a replacement as fast as they can whenever a key employee leaves the company. Also, I believe this will increase employees' engagement. This can be part of their career development. 

Sample of employees ready for the Mentorship Program:

We have 1,549 employees ready for the Program. If we compare statistics, this is a low number compared to the number of people retiring in the short term. 

For now, the only criteria to select people for the mentorship program is "hiring date". Honestly, I do not think that is a good idea. Other factors should be considered:
1. Hiring date
2. Career ambitions
3. Attitude
4. Soft skills

This mentorship program comes as a result from the crisis the company will be facing in the short term. This should stay as a permanent strategy to define succession plans and help employees builfing their career paths. 

## Conclusion
The Company failed to foresee the impact that was coming. With employees working here for a long time, I guess it was hard to anticipate it. Beyond the development of this new mentorship program, we need to find answer to the questions written above. We need to start working on a better strategy for employee development: temporary assignments, succession plans, career plans, and training workshops can be all part of a bigger strategy for employees development and retention.
